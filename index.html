It was June 13th of 2014 that Riley came barreling into the world. His father was a liver Brittany named Rebel and his mother was an orange Brittany named Coral. He was one of the most orange colored pups in his litter and his star marking on his back made him very popular! A little over 8 weeks later in early August he went to his forever home in Pennsylvania. His curiosity and intelligence got him into trouble and there were some pitfalls along the way but he grew to be a large handsome Brittany who is the dog that's beloved by many today </p>
